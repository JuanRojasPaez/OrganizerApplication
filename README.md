User is able to create tasks and add them to a calendar.
Calendar will always display today's date.

If user creates a task and the chosen day is todays date, it will be displayed
as a button on the calendar.

If user creates a task for a different date than today, the array will store it
but will not be displayed until the day is 'today's date'.

The third column displays the number of tasks which have today's date assigned
to them.
